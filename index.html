                <h2>The Bottlenecks in Real-Time Multichannel Audio</h2>
<p>
    Real-time, multichannel audio systems are pushing the limits of traditional CPUs and DSPs. 
    High channel counts and ultra-low-latency requirements make immersive sound experiences difficult to achieve, especially in live or interactive settings.
   Even the best low-latency audio setups struggle to achieve sub-millisecond performance, and surpassing a few hundred channels is challenging and costly.

                <h2>FPGA Innovation for High-Channel, Low-Latency Audio</h2>

<p>
FPGA technology overcomes these limitations through fully parallel, deterministic, and ultra-low-latency computation. 
Operating without an operating system and with zero buffering, FPGAs eliminate the main sources of delay found in traditional architectures. 
This enables unprecedented performance (down to a single sample of latency) while supporting high sampling rates up to 768 kHz for demanding professional applications. 
Their inherent parallelism makes them ideal for spatial audio systems such as Wave Field Synthesis, where independent computations must occur across hundreds of channels simultaneously. 
With extensive GPIOs and flexible interfacing, FPGAs provide scalable, efficient, and high-channel-count processing solutions.
</p>

                <img src="images/fpga.JPG" alt="FPGA">

        </div>


    <p>
Despite their potential, FPGAs have long remained out of reach for most audio developers due to their programming complexity, a gap that Polyphonic is closing.
Leveraging ultra-low latency audio converters and FPGA processing, Polyphonic’s platform achieves an impressive 11μs latency from analog input to analog output and handled hudreds of intput and outputs.

                    <h2>A Compiler Built for Sound</h2>
                  <p>  At the heart of Polyphonic lies a custom compiler that turns high-level C++ or FAUST audio code into efficient FPGA implementations. 
This tool abstracts the complexity of hardware description languages, enabling designers to design, test, and deploy real-time audio systems directly from familiar code. 
By automating the synthesis, interfacing, and optimization processes, Polyphonic allows us to rapidly develop proofs-of-concept for FPGA.
